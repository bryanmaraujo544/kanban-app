> Application for users create and access columns and tasks. They can invite other members to their boards and access other boards if they got invited.

## 💻 How it works

The user when make the register and login get an access to his board, in this board he can creates columns and tasks and update all of the informations about it if he wants. There's a button where the user can invite other members registered in application to his board, and automatically the user invited gains access to the board.

## 💻 How it was made

For the creation of the interfaces I've used the library React as main technology. And to implement the drag and drop functionality I've used the library react-beatiful-dnd, which made my life easier.  
For make all of the business rules and save the relevant data in the database, I've made contact with an API made by me using Node.js, Express.js and Prisma as the main tech's.
